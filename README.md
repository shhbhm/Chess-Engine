# Chess Bot

This repository contains the code for a chess bot I developed using Python. The bot is designed to play chess games against human opponents, utilizing various AI algorithms to make strategic decisions.

## Features

- **AI Algorithms:** Implemented Random Move AI, Greedy Algorithm, MinMax, NegaMax, and Alpha-Beta Pruning.
- **Optimized Performance:** Reduced waiting time by 60% using Alpha-Beta Pruning, with a depth limit set to 4 to ensure efficient decision-making.
- **Positional Scoring:** Detailed evaluation of chess pieces based on their position on the board, including bonuses for controlling key areas.
- **Game Rules:** Fully compliant with standard chess regulations, including castling and en passant.
- **Interactive Play:** Engaging move animations and real-time move logging.
